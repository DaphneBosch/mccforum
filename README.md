## About MCC Forum

MCC Forum is a Forum website for MineCrafterCity. This is a Minecraft server and needed a Forum. That's why i, Shayley, am creating an awesome forum for the server!
At the same time, this will be a project for school.

## What is the idea?

The idea is to let people post things in the Forums. Of course, they have to login first to do that. The login system was included with Laravel. The only thing you have to do is to register and login!

## Can i use it as well?

Yes! The project is now Open Source. You can edit it and even help me when you can. If you have ideas, do not hestitate to use the project and implement your ideas into it.

## Laravel License

I'm currently using Laravel. The Laravel framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
